# complex substitution models 

Mixture models, like partition models, allow more than one substitution model along the sequences. What is the difference between partition and mixture models?

-  However, while a partition model assigns each alignment site a given specific model, mixture models do not need this information. 

- A mixture model will compute for each site its probability (or weight) of belonging to each of the mixture classes (also called categories or components). Since the site-to-class assignment is unknown, the site likelihood under mixture models is the weighted sum of site likelihoods per mixture class.

To start with, the following command:

iqtree -s example.phy -m "MIX{JC,HKY}"
specifies a mixture model (via the MIX keyword in the model string) with two components. The components (1) JC model, and (2) HKY model, are given in curly brackets and separated with a comma. IQ-TREE will then estimate the parameters of both mixture components as well as their weights: the proportion of sites belonging to each component.

Finally, in Bayesian Inference in the latest years has become very fashionable the CAT model. This mixture model allows **each position** on the alignment to evolve differently from the others, whithout needing of any *a priori* knowledge (*i.e* partitioning scheme). IQ-TREE implements a ML variant called **GHOST**([Crotty et al., 2020](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-abstract/69/2/249/5541793?redirectedFrom=fulltext)). However they are very parameters rich and can only be used when analyzing a lot of data (*i.e* phylogenomic).
