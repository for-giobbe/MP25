### Exam sample

The exam will take place over an hour and a half and will be structured as follows:
- 27 multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank questions, each worth 1 point. There are no penalties for incorrect answers.
- 1 open-ended question (maximum three sentences), worth a total of 5 points.

### Closed questions:

**Orthologous genes are:**
 - A. genes generated by gene duplication.
 - **B. homologous genes that diverged after a cladogenetic event.**
 - C. genes sharing the same function.
 - D. genes working properly.

**What is the key difference between empirical and mechanistic substitution models in phylogenetics?**
- A. Empirical models estimate substitution rates from the data during the analysis, while mechanistic models use fixed rates from prior studies.
- **B. Mechanistic models include parameters like substitution rates and base frequencies that are estimated from the dataset, while empirical models use pre-estimated, fixed substitution rates derived from large datasets.**
- C. Empirical models are only used for nucleotide sequences, and mechanistic models are only used for proteins.
- D. Mechanistic models assume all sites evolve at the same rate, while empirical models allow rate variation.

**In a codon-based alignement, insertion and deletions:**
 - A. never occur.
 - **B. they can occur if they involve entire codons.**
 - C. they can occur only at the third codon position.
 - D. they can occur at any position.

**What is the RELL approximation used for in phylogenetics?**
- A. To estimate branch lengths using a relaxed clock model
- B. To compute posterior probabilities in Bayesian tree inference
- **C. To speed up bootstrap support calculations by resampling site-wise log-likelihoods instead of re-estimating trees.**
- D. To convert distance matrices into character-based alignments

**Why is it problematic to perform correlation analyses of traits without considering phylogenetic relationships?**
- A. Because trait values are always measured incorrectly.
- B. Because species are independent data points by default.
- **C. Because related species may share traits due to common ancestry, violating the assumption of independence.**
- D. Because correlation tests only work on genetic sequences.
 
**Which of the following best describes an ideal trait for phylogenetic analysis?**
- A. A trait that evolves so rapidly that it changes in every generation.
- B. A trait that is environmentally induced and independent of ancestry.
- **C. A heritable trait that shows variation among taxa and evolves at a rate appropriate for the divergence times being studied.**
- D. A trait that occurs only in distantly related species due to convergent evolution.
